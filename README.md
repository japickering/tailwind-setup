# Getting started with Tailwind CSS

Using this starter kit you can get up and running fast with Tailwind CSS and React JS.
Tailwind CSS 2.0 uses npm packages: Purge CSS which strips out un-used css for optimising file size and Craco to configure PostCSS.

e.g. Using the @layer directive we can extend core Tailwind CSS modular stylesheets to make re-usable custom css classes.
```
@layer base {
  .myclass {}
} 
```
